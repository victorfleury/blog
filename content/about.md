## <a href="#longstory"></a>Long story

I have been working in the VFX industry for over 10 years now and as a Pipeline TD for almost 10 years.

I have always been insterested in understanding how things work and to do so I really love to take them apart.
So naturally when I first got my hands on a computer, I became fascinated by it and how I could create my own programs.
I have fond memories of taking apart my parents old computer and trying to rebuild it back from scratch, and trying to install any Linux distros I could get my hands on (which was quite a challenge back then, cause no high speed broadband :smile: )

As long as I can remember, I have also been quite fond of cinema and VFX. 
As cliche as it sounds I really loved growing up and watching *Star Wars*, *Back to the future*, *Indiana Jones*, *Jurassic Park* and a lot more, and I think it gave me the movie *bug*.

After graduating form high school, I carried on studying in a DUT (kind of a 2 year diploma) in Computer science.

But after graduating from there, I felt like missing the fun of movies. So I started a new diploma in **Art et Techonologies de l'Image** aka **ATI** at the University Paris8.

There I learned about *DCCs* (Maya, Nuke, Houdini, etc...) and a bit of programming as well.

After graduating from there with a *Master*, I started working as a compositing artist, and then a CG artist.

Somehow when I started working on *Despicable Me 2* I ended up in a role where a lot of tasks needed to be manually done, when in fact things could be automated.
So I started tinkering and creating tools for myself so I could make my artist life easier. 

Quickly I developed a few tools that were used by teammates in the department.

And that was when I had an *'ah-ha"* moment ! I could definitely see myself writing tools and helping artists

From there, I went on working in small feature animation studio in Paris, where I was the only pipeline developer for almost 2 years.

After that I joined [DNEG](https://www.dneg.com) to work on feature animation film *Ron's gone wrong* and had a blast.

I then moved to Montreal to work on the VFX side of the pipeline at DNEG. I was in charge of the main playback tool for a while there.

Ultimately I then joined [RodeoFX](https://www.rodeofx.com) where I am now *Lead pipeline developer* on various projects and mostly driving forward the [USD](https://openusd.org/) pipeline as well as our core infrastructure with [Rez](https://rez.readthedocs.io/)
