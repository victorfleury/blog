# Intro

In this first 2024 blog post, I thought I would share my usual workflow for my development tools and needs


# Steps and Tools that I use

## Tools
First the tools I use everyday : 

- Kitty
- Tmux
- Neovim

Those are my bread and butter for my every day work !

## Steps
As a developer I spend most of my time writing code, or at least I try to cause that's what I enjoy the most.

And to do to so here are the steps I go through :

- Open Kitty to get a new terminal
- Usually I will connect to the work VPN
- Launch my custom `stm` script
