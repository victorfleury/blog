## Long story

I have been working in the VFX industry for over 10 years now and as a Pipeline TD for almost 10 years.

I have always been insterested in understanding how things work and to do so I really love to take them apart.
So naturally when I first got my hands on a computer, I became fascinated by it and how I could create my own programs.
I have fond memories of taking apart my parents old computer and trying to rebuild it back from scratch, and trying to install any Linux distros I could get my hands on (which was quite a challenge back then, cause no high speed broadband :smile: )

As long as I can remember, I have also been quite fond of cinema and VFX. 
As cliche as it sounds I really loved growing up and watching *Star Wars*, *Back to the future*, *Indiana Jones*, *Jurassic Park* and a lot more, and I think it gave me the movie *bug*.
